All managers struggle with being able to stay on top of in-season catch data from multiple sources. To address this, I built a Shiny application in R that synthesizes live data scraped from a google sheet data entry portal. The Shiny app summarizes catch by species, basic length trends, compares to previous years' results, and allows mapping of spatial temperature and salinity results. Together, these provide a quick summary and snapshot of the trends of the current season.  

Other improvements include mapping.
