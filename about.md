Research over the past year has built upon initial results and was presented at several conferences including the American Fisheries Society (AFS) Alaska Student Symposium (where it won the St Hubert Research award for Best Introduction), AFS Western Division Annual Meeting, and at the AFS Western Division Student Colloquium in Corbett, Oregon. The analyses for these presentations used varied statistical approaches including non-Metric Dimensional Scaling and PERMANOVA modeling to make assessments about how the fish communities responded to or were associated with different environmental conditions.
