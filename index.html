<h3 align="center"> Welcome! </h3>
This is the personal webpage for Justin Priest. 
I am a fisheries biologist interested in solving quantitative problems and modeling ecological systems. 
On this site, I'll showcase a few of the unique projects that I've been able to work on, and hopefully provide some useful instructions for others.
